# mindmap.js
Mindmap.js makes it simple to create elegant Mindmaps from HTML and Markup documents in your browser. **No server-side compilation required.**

This project was borne out of my frustration wanting to summarize papers and books in text form but render them as Mindmaps. I took inspiration from the reveal.js framework allowing the decoupling of content from presentation.

## Usage
My goal was to create a standalone client-side rendering of Mindmaps in the most intuitive way possible. You can find working examples for both markup and html in the sample files in the repo. 

### Markup
Mindmap.js uses [strapdown.js](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown) to render markup and allow bootstrap themes.

### Html
Mindmap.js can convert heading and unsorted list elements into Mindmap nodes.
